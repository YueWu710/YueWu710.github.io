I am pursuing a master's degree in Quantitative and Systems Biology at Northwestern University ('26) after completing my B.A. in Biology at UC Santa Barbara (June 2025). I have received training in both computational methods and molecular experiments.

Infer Causal Drivers of Skin Cell Differentiation
======
June 2025 to present

The project integrates variational autoencoder (VAE)-based latent trajectory analysis and Geneformer (a transformer-based algorithm) for single-cell data, and performs in silico perturbations to construct a causal core gene regulatory network that controls human skin cell differentiation.

Below is a diagram of the VAE architecture, along with the current results of applying it to identify driver genes for the undifferentiated-to-differentiated transition.

Apply Control Theory to Redirect Cell Fate Transition 
======
Aug 2025 to present (remote)

Using RNA velocity Jacobians reconstructed by Dynamo, this project applies iLQR (an iterative optimal-control algorithm) to a system where genes serve as control channels, yielding minimal perturbation schedules that steer cells from one fate to another.

Below is the UMAP projection of RNA velocity from the hematopoietic dataset. The red line shows the reference Least Action Path computed by the Dynamo package, and the black line shows the actual trajectory generated by controlling gene expression with the intensity and timing specified in the accompanying Gantt plot.

The system dynamics follow:

$$x_{k+1} = x_k + \Delta t \cdot [f_{vel}(x_k) + \Delta \cdot u_k]$$
- x_k: PCA state vector (30D), representing the state of the system at at time k
- f_vel: velocity field
- Δ: gene PCA loadings
- u_k: gene perturbations (control input)

LQR problem with cost function:

$$ J = Σ_k [x_k^T Q_k x_k + u_k^T R_k u_k] + x_K^T Q_f x_K $$
- Q_k: State deviation cost matrix
- R_k: Control strength cost matrix
- Q_f: Distance to terminal cost matrix
